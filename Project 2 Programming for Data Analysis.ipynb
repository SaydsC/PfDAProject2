    "\n",
    "This project will investigate the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The following list presents the\n",
    "requirements of the project\n",
    "- Undertake an analysis/review of the dataset and present an overview and background.\n",
    "- Provide a literature review on classifiers which have been applied to the dataset and compare their performance\n",
    "- Present a statistical analysis of the dataset\n",
    "- Using a range of machine learning algorithms, train a set of classifiers on the dataset (using SKLearn etc.) and present classification performance results. Detail your rationale for the parameter selections you made while training the classifiers.\n",
    "- Compare, contrast and critique your results with reference to the literature\n",
    "- Discuss and investigate how the dataset could be extended â€“ using data synthesis of new tumour datapoints\n",
    "- Document your work in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "- As a suggestion, you could use Pandas, Seaborn, SKLearn, etc. to perform your analysis.\n",
    "- Please use GitHub to demonstrate research, progress and consistency\n",
